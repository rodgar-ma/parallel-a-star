One of the greatest challenges in the design of realistic Artificial Intelligence (AI) in computer games is agent movement. Pathfinding strategies are usually employed as the core of any AI movement system. In this work, A* search algorithm is used to find the shortest path between the source and destination on image that represents a map or a maze. Finding a path through a maze is a basic computer science problem that can take many forms. The A* algorithm is widely used in pathfinding and graph traversal. Different map and maze images are used to test the system performance (100 images for each map and maze). The system overall performance is acceptable and able to find the shortest path between two points on the images. More than 85\% images can find the shortest path between the selected two points.},

The state-of-the-art is dominated by hierarchical pathﬁnding algorithms which are fast and have small memory overheads but usually return suboptimal paths. In this paper we present a novel search strategy, speciﬁc to grids, which is fast, optimal and requires no memory overhead. Our algorithm can be described as a macro operator which identiﬁes and selectively expands only certain nodes in a grid map which we call jump points. Intermediate nodes on a path connecting two jump points are never expanded. We prove that this approach always computes optimal solutions and then undertake a thorough empirical analysis, comparing our method with related works from the literature. We ﬁnd that searching with jump points can speed up A* by an order of magnitude and more and report signiﬁcant improvement over the current state of the art.},

Dijkstra's is contrary to A-Star, a best-first search algorithm, which can handle the shortest path search with a faster time but not always optimum. By looking at the advantages and disadvantages of Dijkstra's and A-Star, this tutorial discusses the implementation of the two algorithms in finding the shortest path in routes selection between 24 SPBU (gas stations). The routes are located in Medan City and represented in a directed graph. Moreover, the authors compare Dijkstra's and A-star based on the complexity of Big-Theta (Θ) and running time. The results show that the shortest path search between SPBU can be solved with Dijkstra's and A-Star, where in some cases, the routes produced by the two algorithms are different so that the total distance generated is also different. In this case, the running time of A-Star is proven to be faster than Dijkstra's, and it is following A-Star principle which selects the location point based on the best heuristic value while Dijkstra's does not. For the complexity, Dijkstra's is {\textbackslash}Theta({\textbackslash}mathrmn{\textasciicircum}2) and A-Star is {\textbackslash}Theta({\textbackslash}mathrmm{\textbackslash}ast {\textbackslash}mathrmn), where 0łeq {\textbackslash}mathrmmłeq {\textbackslash}mathrmn.},

As a result, an improved multi-objective A-star (IMOA-star) algorithm for mobile robot path planning in a large workspace was designed and implemented in Python 3.8.3 in this study. In four test cases, the proposed IMOA-star is evaluated in a large workspace with dimensions of 7120 cm × 9490 cm, and its performance is compared to the traditional A-star. When compared to the traditional A-star, the results showed that IMOA-star reduced the algorithm process time by 99.98\%, improved path smoothness by 45\%, reduced path length by 1.58\%, and reduced the number of random points by 83.45\%. Finally, the IMOA-star outperforms the traditional A-star in terms of algorithm processing time, path smoothness, path length, and the number of random points. As a result, it should be considered a viable alternative to the traditional A-star for mobile robot path planning in a large workspace.},

We present the first complete algorithm for finding these paths that is sufficiently fast for real-time applications. Furthermore, our algorithm offers a trade-off between running time and solution quality. We then refine our algorithm into an anytime algorithm that first quickly finds a solution, and then uses any remaining time to incrementally improve that solution until it is optimal or the algorithm is terminated.

	abstract = {An automatic method is described for the solution of a certain family of problems. To belong to this family a problem must be expressible in the language of graph theory as that of finding a path between two specified nodes of a specified graph. The method depends upon the evaluation of intermediate states of the problem according to the extent to which they have features in common with the goal state. We define evaluation functions each of which assigns to any state of the problem a value which is in some way related to its ‘distance’ from the goal state. Equivalently we assign to nodes of the corresponding graph values which are related to the distance over the graph from the goal node. Distance is reckoned as the smallest number of arcs needed to connect two nodes. An Algol program, the Graph Traverser, has been written to operate in this context. It is designed in a completely general way, and has two ‘empty’ procedures one of which must be written to specify the structure of the graph, that is the constraints of the problem, and the other to define an evaluation function. Results obtained by supplying the program with definitions of various sliding block puzzles and also a simple problem of algebraic manipulation are reported for a range of evaluation functions.},

This paper presents three new algorithms for efficiently solving this problem, suitable for use in Real-Time Strategy games and other real-time environments. The algorithms are decoupled approaches that break down the problem into a series of single-agent searches. Cooperative A* (CA*) searches space-time for a non-colliding route. Hierarchical Cooperative A* (HCA*) uses an abstract heuristic to boost performance. Finally, Windowed Hierarchical Cooperative A* (WHCA*) limits the space-time search depth to a dynamic window, spreading computation over the duration of the route. The algorithms are applied to a series of challenging, maze-like environments, and compared to A* with Local Repair (the current video-games industry standard). The results show that the new algorithms, especially WHCA*, are robust and efficient solutions to the Cooperative Pathfinding problem, finding more successful routes and following better paths than Local Repair {A}$^*$},

This paper reviews a number of popular A*-based algorithms and techniques from different perspectives. It aims to explore the relationship between various A*-based algorithms.
